# MFP Scraper

## What is this??
This is a tool to download the contents of [musicForProgramming();](https://musicforprogramming.net/latest/), that being every single track they have to offer. While the site does provide a way to download a single track at a time, there isn't any way (that I'm aware of) to download the entire "album" at once. As someone who's seen good internet content disappear all the time, I'm quite the data hoarder and this being another one of my data hoarding projects.

## Installing Dependencies
1. Clone the repo and enter it
2. Ensure you have [Python 3.10.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (or later, but imagine putting breaking changes in a minor release lol)
3. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Settings
TBD

## Running
While in the directory, execute `python main.py` to run the script. This will download all ~7GB(!) worth of tracks to the folder specified in the settings file.
